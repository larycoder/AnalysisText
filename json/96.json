{"cid": "UgjdMhFwvtfPU3gCoAEC", "text": "I was told to watch \"love, rosie\" on my bestfriend wedding. I wasn't invited to his wedding because he just can't invite me. The friendship that we had was so complicated and every promise on being there for each other till we get old obviously won't ever come true because he's with a girl whom he wasn't and didn't want to end up with plus she doesn't fancy the bond that i had with my bestfriend and so, he was force to leave me. It's unfair but it's alright you see. Life goes on.﻿", "time": "1 năm trước", "author": "Nur Raifana Hazrin"}
